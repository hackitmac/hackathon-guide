##Hackathon FAQs
**Will there be accommodations?**  
No, but the hackathon will be a 24hr or 36hr event meaning the venue will be open and you can sleep anywhere. Bring a sleeping bag if you want.

**Is it really free?**  
Yes completely free. Travel, food, free swag all covered!

**Do I need to have experience programming?**  
Definitely not. Hackathon are a great experience and gives you a chance to see what's possible with technology. A suggestion is to join non-competitive teams. Going with friends or people who are just looking to learn. In the meantime you can follow this guide. We'll have workshops soon.

**What to bring!**

+ Passport (if we're going to the states, otherwise not needed)
  + You might need a visa depending on your citizenship (if you're not canadian). 
+ Sleeping Bag
+ Extra clothes
+ Laptop and charger
+ Cash and credit card (preferably credit card since canadian cash isn't accepted in the states)
+ Student ID (These are student hackathons so they maybe check if you're actually a student)
